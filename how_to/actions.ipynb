    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python module defines a set of abstract actions for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) in a 2D grid world. It includes classes and protocols to model abstract actions, grid movements, and one-hot encoded grid movements. The main goal is to provide a flexible framework for experimenting with hierarchical decision-making agents in grid-based environments.\n"

    "## `AbstractActions` Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol defines the structure that abstract action classes should follow. It includes methods to manipulate observations, calculate termination probabilities (`beta`), and evaluate the compatibility of actions with observed transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- **`mask(self, obs: ObsType) -> ObsType`**: Masks the observation, potentially modifying its representation.\n",
    "- **`beta(self, action: ActType, start_obs: ObsType, next_obs: ObsType) -> tuple[bool, bool]`**: Calculates termination probabilities for an action given the start and next observations.\n",
    "- **`compatibility(self, action: ActType, start_obs: ObsType, next_obs: ObsType) -> float`**: Evaluates the compatibility of an action with the observed transition.\n"
